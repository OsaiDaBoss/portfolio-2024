              <h2>Pizza Delivery Roomba</h2>
              <p>
                This project aimed to program the Roomba CyBOT to simulate a pizza delivery driver, which would navigate through a cluttered test environment to deliver two pizzas to two different locations. The challenge was to ensure that the AV could prioritize pizza delivery while avoiding collisions with other objects and obstacles in its path. UART communication and interrupts were used for control.
                The Cybot movement was controlled using the Cybot_move function. ADC was predominantly used to accurately detect the object angle. Sonar was chosen as it provided more accurate distance measurements, although both ADC and sonar were considered for use. ADC proved effective in measuring the boundaries between two objects, while a cliff sensor was employed to prevent the vehicle from moving out of bounds.
                Arrival at the destinations was marked by coming within 5 cm of a skinny pillar, which represented the pizza delivery stops, and a sound was played to indicate the "delivery" had been made. Putty was used for communication, and manual input was received from a keyboard connected to the CyBot and Putty.
                Open Interface and iRobot Sensors, including Bumping, Cliff, Distance, and Angle Sensors, were utilized. The sound function in the oi was used to play music. Interrupts, specifically UART interrupts, were implemented.
                Various components were involved in the project, such as ADC (Infrared Sensor) for object detection, Input Capture (Ping Sensor) for distance measurement, PWM for servo operation, and UART/WiFi for connecting the Cybot to Putty.
